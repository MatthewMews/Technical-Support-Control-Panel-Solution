## Get Office Desktop Shortcuts

This attains the .exes for Microsoft office applications. It searches various office installation folders looking for the .exe of each office product. Once attained, it will then attempt to create a .ink file on the users desktop using the .exe the program has located.

## Call Recordings

The option will open a new GUI form and search a specific network / local directory for call recording files. It will then return the results starting from the oldest date modified to the newest. This allowed me to delete call recordings that the company didnâ€™t require anymore. I also added an option to exempt certain folders from the search in the event a folder needs to be stored on the network for a longer period of time. This was done by making the program read a text file that contained a list of excluded folders.

## Website Links

This will open a new GUI form that displays links to some of the most commonly used websites that I used in my Technical Support role. I found this most useful when working on a new / colleagues computer, as it allowed me to quickly go the websites I needed without having to go find out what the URL was (the URLs were very long for some of the websites!).

## Shortcuts

I added some shortcuts at the bottom of the program that allows me to quickly open certain Windows interfaces. This was especially useful when adding computers to the domain as this shortens the amount of steps I had to take.
